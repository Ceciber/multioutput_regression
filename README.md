# Position Reconstruction in Resistive Silicon Detectors using Multi-Output Regression

This project, completed as part of a Data Science Lab course at Polytechnic of Turin, explores the application of multi-output regression techniques for position reconstruction in resistive silicon detectors. The goal is to improve the accuracy of spatial position estimation in particle detection, which is crucial for various applications in experimental physics and medical imaging.

The repository contains the implementation of multi-output regression algorithms, data preprocessing steps, and analysis results. It aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of these methods in enhancing position accuracy and offers a framework for future research in detector technologies.
